Machine Learning and data science project-Leveraging Periodicity to Improve Quality of Service in Mobile Software Defined Wireless Sensor Network
Concept- In this project i have to predict the periodicity of nodes. The aim of my project is to study how the knowledge of the mobility pattern of nodes can help to
improve the QOS of WSN. For this i have used some Supervised Machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression ,Support Vector Machine which predict the
mobility pattern of nodes accurate up to some extent .I get more accuracy in predicting the periodicity of nodes by using sliding window approach .
